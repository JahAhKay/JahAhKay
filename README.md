# 👋 Hi, I'm Jahkay

🌟 **About Me**  
A curious human with a sharp focus in cybersecurity and penetration testing. I enjoy cracking into the technical depths of decentralized systems, experimenting with blockchain security, and visualizing new app concepts — especially ones that integrate sentiment analytics, wallet tracking, and scalable modular design.

🤝 **Looking to Collaborate**  
I’m eager to connect with like-minded individuals on **entry-level security projects**. Let’s team up and grow together in this ever-evolving field!
